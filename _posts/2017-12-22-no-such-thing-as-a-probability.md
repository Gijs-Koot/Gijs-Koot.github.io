_Work in progress_

This article points to some confusion that arises. A research organisation has calculated buildings that have a 1 in 100000 probability that someone dies in an earthquake. I'm not surprised about confusion arising here. Such a claim doesn't make any sense without a reference to a model, to data being used. There is just no such thing as a probability, without a reference to a model. 

I'd like to look at this a bit deeper, because probably (...), or let's say, maybe, it was all pretty well founded in the original source. Maybe later!
