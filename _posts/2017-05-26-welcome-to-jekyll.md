The combination of Jekyll with Github Pages was pretty painless I must say. Every year I try out a new blog engine, then leave it there for a while without actually adding new blogs. Last year's effort is still on [http://gijskoot.nl](http://gijskoot.nl), I will change it when I come around to it.

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
    print("Hi, {name}")
{% endhighlight %}
