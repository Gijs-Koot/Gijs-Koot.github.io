My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1809895395">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Very funny and creative. The writing is vivid and sparkling, and somehow reminds me of the style of Jack Kerouac in On the Road in how it swings. I read the book over a longer timespan and I had some trouble remembering the many storylines and characters that are in it. The book feels rich, as there are many interpretations and undertones that can be read in it. For me, it was mostly just very funny. The description of Milo making it big as a trader is an all-time highlight in reading for me. This book is a monumental effort that I would recommend to anyone.
