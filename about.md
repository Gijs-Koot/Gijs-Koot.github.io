Hi, my name is Gijs Koot. I am a Data Scientist working in Amsterdam, at Urban Science, where I split my time between teaching about data analysis and applying it in projects I do for clients. This is a personal blog. I have a MSc. in Mathematics, and my interest at the moment lies with Bayesian Modeling. Get in touch if you're interested, via LinkedIn or Twitter.
