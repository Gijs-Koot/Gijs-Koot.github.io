Hi, my name is Gijs Koot. I am Lead Data Scientist at [Spotr.ai](https://www.spotr.ai/). We gather and analyze data on buildings and homes. On this website I'm writing blog posts on topics related to statistics, mathematics or programming. Below you see me posing in our office building, wearing a copy of Anna Karenina, a book which, I am proud to say, have actually read.
