This year, 130k participants sent in the answer to the first puzzle, and around 10% of them persevered and finished all of the puzzles. There is a competition where every morning, the first 100 solutions get points awarded. My personal goal was to just finish the puzzles, following the strict time schedule would be an additional challenge I am not up for at this time. \n",

I have been following and experimenting with Julia over the last two years, but I haven't started using it professionally. Python and `pytorch` have been very effective for us. After this experience, I have become even more convinced that Julia is a candidate for replacing Python as the most popular language for data science. In general, its advanced compilation system is an advantage. And as I'm learning and working with the language, it just feels very well designed to me. \n",

However, these libraries don't work together well with other parts of the language or other packages, unless they are specifically designed for working together. Things such as automatic differentiation have to be built on top of an ecosystem. I think of `torch` and `numpy` as sublanguages of Python, with their own datatypes, statically typed arrays. That is not a problem in itself maybe, and very effective for the coming years, but I think in the long run, this can never match the possibilities in Julia. In the python ecosystem, interoperability is organized with brilliant, but cumbersome constructs like the `__array__` interface. That one works well, but who is familiar with `__geo_interface__` interface? To me, these ideas are all efforts to get performance by using Python's great flexibility to work around the imcompatiblity between dynamic typing and a real array type. In short, data comes in the form of big collections, and to work with those fast, I believe you need fixed-length data types. Julia has them. "
