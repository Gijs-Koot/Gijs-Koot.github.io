Prior to this project, my experience with the language was working through some a couple of chapters in [Quantecon](https://julia.quantecon.org).

This year, 130000 participants sent in the answer to the first puzzle, and around 10% of them persevered and finished all of the puzzles. There is a competition where every morning, the first 100 solutions get points awarded. \n",

    "In my job, I am primarily a Python programmer, and I sometimes use R for visualization or model fitting specifically. I have been following and experimenting with Julia over the last two years, but I haven't started using it professionally. Python and `pytorch` have been very effective for us. After this experience, I have become even more convinced that Julia is a candidate for replacing Python as the most popular language for data science. In general, its advanced compilation system is an advantage. And as I'm learning and working with the language, it just feels very well designed to me. "

    "The big advantage of Julia it has over Python in my eyes is that you can program performant algorithms in the language itself. In Python, there are many packages for fast linear algebra, such as `numpy` or `torch`. However, these libraries don't work together well with other parts of the language or other packages, unless they are specifically designed for working together. Things such as automatic differentiation have to be built on top of an ecosystem. I think of `torch` and `numpy` as sublanguages of Python, with their own datatypes, statically typed arrays. That is not a problem in itself maybe, and very effective for the coming years, but I think in the long run, this can never match the possibilities in Julia. In the python ecosystem, interoperability is organized with brilliant, but cumbersome constructs like the `__array__` interface. That one works well, but who is familiar with `__geo_interface__` interface? To me, these ideas are all efforts to get performance by using Python's great flexibility to work around the slowness that is caused by dynamic typing not being compatible with an array type. In short, data comes in the form of big collections, and to work with those fast, you need fixed-lenght data types. "
